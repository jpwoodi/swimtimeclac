Going back to the chest press, your arms move back towards the center but no closer than shoulder width. Wash, rinse, repeat.\nTriple Switch = Push off the wall and kick on your side. The arm lower in the water should be straight out in front of you in a streamline-like position. Your other arm should be at or above the surface of the water at your side as though it's in a pocket. Keep your face looking at the bottom of the pool. After 6-8 kicks take 3 strokes, 6-8 more kicks, then 3 more strokes. Wash, rinse, repeat.\n2 Kicks -> 1 Pull= Pretty self explanatory.
